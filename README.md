# pyscenario

Date: 3rd April 2018

This package is intended to be a port of the R package 'scenario' https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scenario/, used for constructing scenario trees for multi-stage stochastic programming.

The package is in very early stages of development as of the date of this writing and development will likely be slow.
